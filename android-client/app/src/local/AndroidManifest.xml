        LOCAL FLAVOR ONLY: Allow cleartext (HTTP) traffic

        This is required for local development where the device connects to:
        - Next.js dev server on LAN: http://192.168.1.13:3000

        Android 9+ (API 28+) blocks cleartext traffic by default for security.
        This override applies ONLY to the "local" flavor (localDebug build).

        Production and staging flavors use HTTPS, so this won't affect them.

thx. please create a folder in @docs named checklists. creat one checklist for local ->
development, amd one for development -> production

numbered items in checklists and not too much fluff (we can use the document you just updated
for teaching). these new checklists are mainly for the ops ppl to track progress, and remind
temselves what step they are on. does this make sense?

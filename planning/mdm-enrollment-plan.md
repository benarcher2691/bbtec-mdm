# Educational MDM Enrollment System - Implementation Plan

**Approach**: Google Android Management API with Node.js backend

## Phase 1: Google Cloud Setup
- Create Google Cloud project
- Enable Android Management API
- Set up service account credentials
- Store credentials securely

## Phase 2: Node.js Backend
- Initialize Express.js project with required dependencies
- Install Google API client library (`googleapis`)
- Create endpoints:
  - `POST /api/enterprise/create` - Create enterprise enrollment
  - `POST /api/enrollment-token` - Generate enrollment token
  - `POST /api/policy` - Create/update device policy
  - `GET /api/qr/:token` - Generate QR code image
  - `GET /api/devices` - List enrolled devices

## Phase 3: Policy Configuration
- Create a simple default policy JSON with:
  - Password requirements (e.g., minimum length)
  - One additional rule (e.g., disable camera or enforce Wi-Fi)
- Implement policy creation via Android Management API

## Phase 4: QR Code Generation
- Integrate QR code library (`qrcode` npm package)
- Format enrollment token into proper Android provisioning payload
- Generate downloadable QR code image

## Phase 5: Basic Web UI
- Create simple HTML page served by Express
- Add "Generate Enrollment QR" button
- Display generated QR code
- Show list of enrolled devices (basic table)

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- Create README with setup instructions
- Document how to factory reset Android device
- Test enrollment flow with physical device or emulator
- Add troubleshooting notes

## Deliverable
Working PoC where you can generate a QR code, scan it on a factory-reset Android device, and have it enroll with a basic policy applied.

## Project Scope
**Type**: Quick proof-of-concept
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Educational demonstration of MDM enrollment flow

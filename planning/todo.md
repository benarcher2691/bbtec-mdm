### ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Android Management API - Default Policy Setup

**Issue:** Need to properly configure the default policy in Google's Android Management API console.

**Current Situation:**
- Policy is defined in code (`src/app/actions/android-management.ts`)
- Policy updates via API endpoint (`/api/update-policy`)
- Still experiencing issues:
  - Screen lock/PIN prompts during enrollment
  - App installation affecting all devices on shared policy

**Actions Needed:**
1. **Visit Google Cloud Console**
   - Navigate to Android Management API
   - Review/set the `default-policy` properly
   - Ensure `PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED` is set

2. **Consider Policy Architecture**
   - Current: Single `default-policy` for all devices
   - Option A: Keep shared policy (simpler, affects all devices)
   - Option B: Create device-specific policies (more complex, per-device control)
   - Decision needed based on use case

3. **Test Enrollment Flow**
   - Verify no PIN/password required
   - Confirm app installation works correctly
   - Document expected behavior

**References:**
- Policy configuration: `src/app/actions/android-management.ts` (line 170)
- Policy guide: `planning/policy-configuration-guide.md`
- Update endpoint: `src/app/api/update-policy/route.ts`

**Status:** üî¥ Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Assigned:** TBD
**Due:** ASAP

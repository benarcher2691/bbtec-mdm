# Planning Documentation

This directory contains active planning documents and development session notes for the bbtec-mdm project.

## 📂 Directory Structure

### Active Documents

**Current Plan:**
- **`PLAN.md`** - Current development plan (promotion path + future work)
- **`ROADMAP-NEXT-STEPS.md`** - Long-term roadmap and feature backlog

### Historical Documentation

**Archive:**
- **`archive/`** - Completed implementation plans, historical session notes, and research
  - `archive/2025-11-session/` - November 2025 session (multi-env setup, offline-first, serial number fixes)

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**For current development:**
- Check **`PLAN.md`** for current priorities and next steps
- Review **`ROADMAP-NEXT-STEPS.md`** for long-term feature planning

**For operations:**
- See `../CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and workflow
- See `../docs/` for technical documentation

**For context/history:**
- Browse `archive/` for completed work and historical decisions

## 📝 Document Maintenance

**Guidelines:**
- Keep `PLAN-*.md` focused on FUTURE work only (no history)
- Archive completed planning docs to `archive/YYYY-MM-session/`
- Promote valuable learnings to `../docs/` for permanent reference
- Update `ROADMAP-NEXT-STEPS.md` as priorities change
- Create new `PLAN-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for major milestones

**When to Archive:**
- Session planning docs when work completes
- Implementation plans when features ship
- Research artifacts after decisions made
- Technical reports after issues resolved

**When to Promote to docs/:**
- Patterns that apply long-term (e.g., authentication, testing)
- Operational guides for production use
- Architecture decisions that affect future development
- Build and deployment procedures
